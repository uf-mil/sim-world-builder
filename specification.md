# Simulation World Builder -> Oixel Romero

## Description
This project aims to develop a web-based GUI for simulation world development. The tool will streamline the process of building simulation worlds without requiring the full environment to be launched. By leveraging minimal system requirements, the interface will make it faster and easier to design, configure, and test simulated environments for Subjugator.

## Impact
__For members:__ hands-on experience with simulation design and tool development, gaining skills directly applicable to robotics, autonomy, and software infrastructure.

__For the lab:__ faster, more reliable world-building with less trial-and-error, enabling robust and reproducible environments for testing and development.

## Steps
1. Ensure building sessions are saved locally
2. Create Interface base layout
3. Collect files of Pool Worlds <br />
a. Create a section with dropdown to select pool <br />
b. Generate a display for each pool
4. Collect files of Prop Items <br />
a. Create a section to select props <br />
b. Show display for each prop
5. Get World button (Generate world file)
6. Preview World Button (Quality of Life, Extra Feature)
